# Spotify Data Analysis

Do you ever wonder which of your adulthood’s metal bands is most popular?
Could Iron Maiden sound happier than Metallica?
Are Iced Earth’s songs more energetic than the other bands songs?

The purpose of this project is to show how Spotify’s extracted data could be used to draw some meaningful insights.

Python is used for data cleaning and preprocessing and different imputing techniques are used for missing values.

Statistical methods, visualizations and machine learning algorithms are applied in the Dataset.




Metallica, Iron Maiden, Iced Earth, Blind Guardian and few more were chosen as bands of choice.
